# Additional Information

Posts can only be created, edited and deleted by the administrator (by default, the first user in the database is the administrator). All users can comment on posts. If you want to create, edit and delete posts, you will need to delete ***blog.db*** (which will delete all posts, users and comments). Note: I did not write the CSS or javascript for this project.
